# Research Overview

## Participants

In the spring of 2010, I conducted interviews with thirteen members of the SFPD. My liaison within the police department was Lt. Greg Yee of the Technology Division. In coordination with Lt. Yee, I was able to recruit participants from a wide range of ranks and roles within the SFPD, as well as a mix of civilian employees and sworn officers. Interviews took place at 850 Bryant St, which is the SFPD operational headquarters, and the Taraval station, both in San Francisco. 

* Interviews with 13 members of the SFPD
	* Mix of sworn and civilian
	* Range of ranks
	* Range of roles

* Individual participants were selected by the SFPD, with my input for the role and rank distribution

## Methodology ##



* Semistructured interviews
* On-site
* 45-120 minutes
* Single interviewer
* Audio recording
* Grounded theory approach

## Limitations ##

* Participants selected by police department
  * Limited to people the PD thought appropriate
* Participants were representative of the range of roles at the PD, but not the proportion of employees in those roles
* Because of our association with the city of SF, some participants expressed reticence when sharing controversial or negative opinions about the city's policies or practices
