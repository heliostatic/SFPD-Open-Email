## Current Use

### Email use is socially determined ##

>"I would say I prefer email for most communication." (P11, notes)

>"In the world of police work, we're up-to-date as far as technology is concerned, but my personal belief... being a police officer is a different world. When you're on patrol, after the morning meeting, you hit the ground running." (P7, notes)

>"I don't use email in my job." (P9, notes)

The most reliable predictor of email use within the police department is the use of email by peers, either within or outside the department. 

* Use varies with rank and role
* Perception of value depends heavily on social demand
* Email is often used to communicate outside of the police department
	* Public
	* Other LEAs
* Email is sometimes used to communicate with superiors
* Users have different feelings about, and value differently, sending and receiving email
* ""

### Trust and reliability are the most critical factors when communicating ##

>"I'd worry if it were automated, something would go wrong." (P2, notes)

>"My gut feeling is no, it isn't possible to have sufficient technical safeguards." (P11, notes)

* Human communication systems are the most trusted
  * Humans are trusted to:
		* obey chain of command,
		* make good decisions about who to share information with,
		* properly follow procedures,
		* be accountable for their mistakes. (a tie into the PAIT side of things - many hands with automated systems)
	* Automatic filters are hard to trust.
		* It is hard for users to reconcile their personal views about privacy with the views of privacy embedded in a computer system.
* Computers are viewed as somewhat unreliable/slow. This decreases their value, especially when they are shared. Logging in for the first time on a system can take up to 10 minutes.

### There isn't a developed culture or set of policies around computer use generally, email use specifically, nor is there consistent, extensive training on the use of these tools for non-investigative purposes ##

>"I don't know. We have a computer policy about what you can load on them, but I don't know that they've come out with thou shalt not email this or that." (P8, notes)

>"General Order 10.08 came out in 2002 and addressed the personal use of computers, what passwords should be on there, etc. That needs to be updated to address changes in technology and new equipment." (P4, notes)

>"San Francisco is unique. You'll find there's not one set way of doing things here." (P6, notes)

* The only DGO regarding email use is from 2002 and addresses inappropriate, but not appropriate, use.
* There is little awareness or, or request for, disclosure of email communication to the public.
* There is no training on what information can or can't be shared over email.
* In contrast, there is some training and policy about police reports, as they are often released to the public.
* People have developed personal habits and standards for separating work and personal email.
	* Practices vary, but most users believe they have good habits, even when their habits are described by other people as being examples of bad habits.
		* eg, 
			* Sending work email from personal accounts
			* Checking personal email accounts from work
			* Sending (non-sensitive) information between work and personal accounts
* Some users view email as being a tool that has the potential to disrupt the chain of command, again because of norms rather than technical differences between email and, for example, interoffice memos

### (NOT SURE HOW TO CHARACTERIZE THIS) Individuals have access to technology beyond what is provided by the department ###

>"I hardly ever use the sfgov email. It's so hard to get around. I mostly use an external, dedicated account." (P4, notes)

>"I prefer to communicate via cellphone... It has tools you can use, maps, navigation... It would help out a lot if the computers in the cars had GPS. My phone alone can do more than the computer can do." (P9, notes)

* The department doesn't provide mobile devices to patrol officers, but most patrol officers have and carry personal mobile phones. Some of these phones include email. Even those that don't have email have cell phones with cameras, which provides them with the ability to share images from the field to the station, and more problematically, from the station to the field.
* Commercial email systems provide features not available on the SFPD email system, like large attachments and easy access from home.
* Examples:
  * personnel use non-sf issued technology and applications to conduct sfpd work, including email
  * examples of what they use
  * examples of why (not provided by sfpd; provided but lacks features)

### Computers are viewed as shared resources by many users

* The computer system uses roaming profiles and a vendor provided web workstation, with the effect that any user can login to any computer and have all of their files and settings.
	* Many users made comments to the effect that they don't have their "own" computers, even if they only ever use one computer and they are typically the only user of that computer. I've called this "no home"

## Openness and Transparency

### Users understand and respect the public right to information, but worry about balancing that with the ability of the PD to do its job

>"Everybody can't have everything, but my gut feeling is that if there is a legal reason, an entitlement to access, then so be it. Otherwise, maybe everybody should just do their own jobs... However, there is absolutely no justification to hide things that need to be public, even if it's terrible. You have to sack up and own it." (P11, notes)

>"The Blackberries, with the messages back and forth on the Blackberries, there's a lot of preliminary information [during investigations] shared on those, which are PIN messages, not email." (P2, notes)

>"There are certainly things you wish people hadn't said, but they're not covered by any kind of protection." (P2, notes)

>"There's a culture in policing of being pretty careful who you tell what, sometimes to the point where it's pretty silly." (P2, notes)

>"If people need to see everything we're doing, they have too much time on their hands." (P5, notes)

>"Transparency is important. The public is entitled to that. But you have to be able to operate the government safely and effectively. There must be an analysis under which the people's entitlement to be privy to the operation of their government comports with the safe and efficient operation of that government." (P11, notes

* Within the police department, there is culture of protection of information
	* quote from Lt. Silverman
* For police, there is "right to know, need to know" training and attitude, which colors their views.
	* The balancing of interests is a traditional privacy view in the sphere of public access to government information
* Many users are not directly aware of the CPRA

### Transparent email will lead to performative behavior

>"I think it would make me more formal in my writing." (P2, notes)

>"You definitely want to make sure you have spellcheck on. And what about people who don't have English as a first language?" (P5, notes)

* quotes from staff services about spell checking, chief about not always being thoughtful but how a shift to transparency would require that

### Initial user reaction to transparency would be decreased use

>"I think it would stifle communication." (P2, notes)

>"The world is such a litigious place, you want to be careful what you put in email." (P5, notes)

>"Definitely. I would use the phone more than send an email." (P6, notes)

* Every respondent said they would use email less (or not at all) and rely on other forms of communication, even if those forms were less efficient, if the email system was transparent
	* Unpacking this, it seems like a lot of the concern was about not knowing what would be made available.
		* Quotes from respondents about:
			* deliberative process,
			* confidential material,
			* security issues.
	* Contrast with openness of police reports, police radio channel
