# Findings #

The findings from the interviews are divided into two sections. In the first section, I have identified themes in the current use of email by the SFPD. These include the reasons people use email, issues with the current system, and uses of technology outside what the department issues. In the second section, I've identified issues pertaining to privacy, transparency, and the use of email.

## Current Use

### Email use is socially contingent ##

The most reliable predictor of email use within the police department is the use of email by peers, either within or outside the department. Among participants with department issued email accounts, email is used to communicate with a wide variety of parties, including peers within a division, managers or superior officers, outside agencies, city attorneys, contractors and vendors, and the public. Participants whose interactions are primarily with other email users are most likely to prefer email as a communication medium. As one participant clearly put it, "I would say I prefer email for most communication," (P11, notes). The converse is also true. For participants with email accounts who interact primarily with members of the department who don't have email, it is not the preferred form of communication, regardless of whether a particular interaction could take place over email. One participant described this mindset particularly well:
>In the world of police work, we're up-to-date as far as technology is concerned, but my personal belief... being a police officer is a different world. When you're on patrol, after the morning meeting, you hit the ground running. (P7, notes)

Because of the disparity of use within the department, participants situated at the boundaries between groups that use email extensively and groups that either don't have or don't use email found email particularly problematic. These participants found they were often required to use email for reporting to their superiors (P7, P8, P13, notes), and were expected to respond in the same medium for those communications, but couldn't rely on email for communicating with peers or subordinates. Consequently, they tended to view email as an inconvenience that took time and attention, but offered little benefit.

Participants also valued sending and receiving email differently. Participants more often valued the ability to send email over receiving (P3, notes). In part this is due to norms of use and etiquette, as discussed below, but participants also attributed the difference to the asynchronous nature of email. The convenience of being able to send an email at any time became an inconvenience when it meant having to check email throughout the day.

### Trust and reliability are the most critical factors when communicating ##

In police work, trust is critical. In many of the interviews, participants indicated that people are trusted, while machines are not. For important communication, interoffice memo (IOM) is the preferred means of delivery. This is especially true for sensitive or confidential information (P3, P6, P7, notes). Conversely, email is viewed as inherently insecure, "Anything can be hacked. It might just be a question of when," (P8, notes). One participant said she feels comfortable sending anything by email, but only because she knows and has independently verified the identities of everyone she corresponds with (P10, notes). Another way in which the difference in trust manifests is in participants' sense of chain of command. In explaining why IOM is preferred over email, a participant said, "With email, someone can send a message to anyone, and you won't know. With [IOM] you send it to your superior, and you know it follows the chain of command," (P3, notes).

There is nothing inherent to the technology that makes email less able to be sent in line with the chain of command, yet for many participants, there is something inherently untrustworthy about the medium. The same belief if was expressed by participants discussing sharing information with the public. Today, information that is shared with the public goes through a human filter in the police department. For some information, the filter is the legal division. For other information, such as police reports, the records clerk manages most disclosures. When asked about automated systems for sharing information with the public, participants were uncomfortable. As one participant said, "I'd worry if it were automated, something would go wrong," (P2, notes). Another had similar concerns, "My gut feeling is no, it isn't possible to have sufficient technical safeguards," (P11, notes).

In addition to the culture of the police department, which has long put trust in people and processes to ensure consistent, appropriate behavior, there is the question of accountability. Removing human actors from a system of information transmission and disclosure makes it unclear how to assign blame when there is a problem. At the recent Pervasive and Autonomous Information Technology (PAIT) conference in Cincinnati, this question was addressed directly. Since the mid-nineties, there has been work considering accountability in human-computer systems (Nissenbaum, 1994), but as technology gets more sophisticated, autonomous agents can perform many of the tasks previously performed by human actors. If the filtering of documents to be shared with the public is performed by a piece of software, who is accountable when something is shared inappropriately? Faced with this question, and no clear answer, the participants in these interviews expressed distrust of automated systems and preferred to rely on tested processes relying on human actors.

Related to the issue of trust is the issue of reliability. One reason cited by some participants for not using email is the time it takes. In many areas of the department, computers are shared resources. For accountability, users must login to computers with their own, unique usernames. On some computers, this can take as long as ten minutes (P8, notes), since the department uses "roaming profiles" that must pull individual user data from a central server (P1, notes). After logging in to the desktop system, users must login to the email system, which requires a different username and password. If any of these systems is experiencing technical issues, the user is not able to send an email. Consequently, for users without dedicated computers, sending an email often takes ten times as long as making a phone call.

### There isn't a developed culture or set of policies around computer use generally, email use specifically, nor is there consistent, extensive training on the use of these tools for non-investigative purposes ##

>"I don't know. We have a computer policy about what you can load on them, but I don't know that they've come out with thou shalt not email this or that." (P8, notes)

The provisioning and use of email within the department has been a slow and piecemeal process. One participant recalled getting an email account through the department as early as the mid-nineties, although it was not an sfgov.org account (P12, notes). Other participants still do not have email accounts. In the late nineties, the department adopted the Lotus Notes email system, which is still uses. The first, and only, general order (GO/DGO)that discusses the use of email is 10.08, which was written in 2002. About that order, one participant said, "General Order 10.08 came out in 2002 and addressed the personal use of computers, what passwords should be on there, etc. That needs to be updated to address changes in technology and new equipment," (P4, notes). Most participants are not aware of the email provisions in DGO 10.08, although it is publicly availably. One typical response, when asked about whether there are any official policies regarding the use of email, is, "I'll have to plead the 5th on that. I'm not sure," (P8, notes).

Part of the issue is a lack of formal training on the appropriate use of email. Many participants expressed a positive view of the training offered by the department, but when asked about training specific to email, most could not recall training on the proper use of email. One participant recalled email "as another example of a medium in which we should not sexually harass coworkers. Something like that," (P11, notes). No participant could recall training about what information should be shared via email.

Despite the lack of official policy about appropriate use of email, many participants have developed a sense of what is appropriate to discuss over email, and how email ought to be used. However, many of these views conflict with the views expressed by other participants. Some participants send personnel files and other confidential or sensitive materials by email, while other participants said that it would always be inappropriate to send confidential material, including personnel or disciplinary matters, by email. Some participants like having the ability to send to many recipients, for example when sharing a weekly newsletter, while other participants feel that email should be sent to as few recipients as possible, as would be the case with interoffice memos. One participant captured this variety by saying, "San Francisco is unique. You'll find there's not one set way of doing things here," (P6, notes).

The lack of clear policies about the appropriate use of email is in marked contrast to the training and policy about how to write police reports. This may not be surprising, given how integral police reports are to the daily operation of the department, but there are important parallels between the two. Police reports are regularly released to the public through trials and public records act requests. Yet when asked whether they received explicit training about what information in police reports could be made public, most participants were not sure, with the exception of the names of domestic abuse victims, which all participants recognized as potentially non-disclosable. Instead, the SFPD has a 91 page report writing manual instructing officers the correct way to write police reports, and a general order (GO 3.16) specifically about the release of police reports to the public. The department has taken great care and invested significant effort in training officers the correct way to write reports without burdening them with the legal intricacies of public release. Email is also subject to public records act requests and discovery in trials, yet there is no equivalent training offered.

In addition to email, police have a variety of alternative media for communication with electronic text. Besides department issued email, officers have the ability to send text messages through the Computer Assisted Dispatch (CAD) system in the patrol cars, the Web Workstation software provided on all desktops, an intranet based messaging system, and for some members of the department, PIN messaging on department issued Blackberry devices, SMS via personal cell phone, and email via non-department issued email accounts. There are varying levels of auditing, control, and access to all of these systems, and no participants were aware of training or policies addressing the appropriate use of these technologies for conducting police business. 

###Individuals have access to technology beyond what is provided by the department ###

The SFPD has employs many technologies in the service of more effective crime prevention. Nevertheless, there are many technologies available to the general public that are not fully deployed within the police department. In some cases, when a technology offers tangible benefits, individuals use technologies that aren't purchased or deployed by the police department, and use those technologies in the fulfillment of their duties with the police department.

In general, cell phones are not provided to officers by the police department. Between thirty and forty members of the department have officially issued Blackberry devices (Meeting with city, notes), but these are typically issued lieutenants, captains, and members of the command staff or technical staff. Nevertheless, many patrol officers carry personal cell phones that they use in the course of duty (P9, notes). Patrol officers have several forms of communication available to them, including their mobile vehicle terminals (also know as mobile data terminals or mobile data computers, MVT/MDT/MDC) and radio. However, several participants said that many patrol officers use cell phones to communicate with other officers on patrol, with the station, and with members of the community. 

Cell phones are especially well suited to communicating with the public, and in Ingleside, there has been an experiment to provide beat officers with cell phones paid for by local businesses (SF Examiner, 2009) (P13, notes). Cell phones are also useful when there is a code 33, indicating that the radio is tied up (P13, notes), or when an officer needs to contact a specific colleague, such as a officer responsible for dealing with issues in the homeless community. In addition to being used for communication, modern cell phones can provide services not otherwise available, "I prefer to communicate via cellphone... It has tools you can use, maps, navigation... It would help out a lot if the computers in the cars had GPS. My phone alone can do more than the computer can do," (P9, notes).

The current department policy on cell phones, DGO 10.07, was last revised in 1996. It does not address the use of cell phones by patrol officers, nor does it address the use of cell phones with advanced functionality. Indeed, the devices available today have functionality that would have been difficult to imagine in 1996.

Participants also discussed their use of non-department issued email accounts. Many participants, both those with and without department issued email accounts, indicated that they use non-department issued email accounts (meaning accounts not at the sfgov.org domain) for work email. As one participant said, "I hardly ever use the sfgov email. It's so hard to get around. I mostly use an external, dedicated account," (P4, notes). The most common reasons for using third party email accounts were the poor usability of the Lotus Notes email client, limitations on file attachment size, and challenges accessing the sfgov email account from home. Several participants said they use non-department issued accounts at home to send themselves articles relevant to work at their sfgov accounts. Other participants described using non-department issued accounts to back up non-sensitive files or information for easy retrieval. One participant mentioned using a non-department issued account because a request for an sfgov account had not been filled, and an email account was required for work (P13, notes).

In every case, participants said that they are careful not to share sensitive information over non-sanctioned channels. Nevertheless, most participants indicated using at least one form of non-department issued communication.

## Openness and Transparency

In the course of this research, I posed a hypothetical situation to the participants. It was very broad, and designed to evoke an emotional and exploratory response. The situation I posed was for participants to "imagine a website where a member of the public is able to search through and read email sent and received by all city employees. Some messages, and some parts of other messages, will be filtered out of this system to comply with the law, and will not be available to the public." From the ensuing discussion, I've identified three major themes. For the purposes of the following discussion, the system described in the hypothetical is referred to as an "open email" system.

### Users understand and respect the public right to information, but worry about balancing that with the ability of the PD to do its job

Every participant expressed a strong commitment to the public's right to information, but this was often balanced by a competing interest:
>Transparency is important. The public is entitled to that. But you have to be able to operate the government safely and effectively. There must be an analysis under which the people's entitlement to be privy to the operation of their government comports with the safe and efficient operation of that government. (P11, notes)

Within the CPRA itself there are many exemptions, allowing for voluntary non-disclosure. Most participants were not familiar with the CPRA, so they were unable to comment on specific provisions. Nevertheless, there was an pervasive sense that public disclosure should be tempered by individual privacy rights, public safety, and the need for the government to be able to operate efficiently. There was, in many cases, something else as well. A sense that, while the public has a right to the information produced by and about the government, that perhaps they ought not to always exercise it. Said one participant, "If people need to see everything we're doing, they have too much time on their hands," (P5, notes). Another participant felt the tension more acutely:
>"Everybody can't have everything, but my gut feeling is that if there is a legal reason, an entitlement to access, then so be it. Otherwise, maybe everybody should just do their own jobs... However, there is absolutely no justification to hide things that need to be public, even if they're terrible. You have to sack up and own it." (P11, notes)

One participant attributed the tension expressed by many as a cultural norm, saying, "There's a culture in policing of being pretty careful who you tell what, sometimes to the point where it's pretty silly," (P2, notes). Another mentioned that within the department, a great deal of sensitive information is collected and shared, and that to minimize the potential for misuse, there is a policy of "right to know, need to know," (P3, notes). This policy serves as an internal guide and a formal policy that dictates who has access to what information. It is part of the policy that regulates access to criminal information databases, investigation files, and operational details, and was mentioned explicitly or alluded to by many of the participants.

Several participants also mentioned the privacy rights of the public as significant concerns in an "open email" system. One participant described how members of the public send reports of crimes to a shared SFPD email account, and worried that those emails would become public, exposing sensitive information, or merely by exposing potentially unfounded accusations against other members of the public (P8, notes).

Finally, there is a sense that the public should trust the police sometimes. The analogy one participant drew was to the use of firearms, "There has to be a certain amount of trust from the public. We're trusted to carry guns, which the public pays for, but I wouldn't let a member of the public hold my gun," (P13, notes).

### Transparent email will lead to performative behavior

In addition to concerns about efficiency, public safety, and privacy, many participants expressed opinions about the way an open email system would change their use of email. A common sentiment was about stylistic changes, "I think it would make me more formal in my writing," (P2, notes), and some participants felt more self-conscious, "You definitely want to make sure you have spellcheck on. And what about people who don't have English as a first language?" (P5, notes). For some participants, the issue raised questions about their current use of email, "After six years, I'm pretty careful about what I say in emails, but not always," (P8, notes). Among all participants, there was a sense that "open email" would lead to more thoughtful, or more deliberate, use of email. As one participant said, "it reduces the freedom to be wrong" (P8, notes).

Latent in this finding is the Foucauldian sense of self-regulation in the face of pervasive sousveillance (Foucault, 1995). The potential for surveillance as a means of exerting power has been explored in the online space (Boyle, 1997) through a Foucauldian lens, but in these findings we see is potentially an inversion of the traditional dynamic. Rather than the state exercising power through surveillance of the public, through the involuntary disclosure of communication that participants feel is relatively private, the public is able to exercise power through sousveillance. And as in Bentham's panopticon, those under observation consider action in line with the image they feel they are meant to portray.

### Email would be used less

After expressing concerns about the potential harms of "open email" and thinking about new expressions of self-regulation, I encouraged participants to think about how such a system would effect their own use of email. Consistently, participants said that if there were an "open email" system, they would use email less. One typical response was to shift communication from email to another form of communication, "Definitely. I would use the phone more than send an email," (P6, notes). For some, this shift would clearly entail using a less efficient form of communication, "Email is so efficient, moving away would really slow us down," (P5, notes).

Several reasons for the decrease in use were cited. Some participants were concerned about the possibility of subordinates viewing their superiors' email in order to gain early information about transfers or position openings. Others saw the possibility of exhaustive email searches being used in retaliation in order to commit "organizational terror," (P2, notes). Another participant referred to the use of email in crafting new policies, and worried that "open email" would inhibit honest discussion. Many participants expressed concern for the privacy and safety of the officers themselves. Among these concerns was a fear that "personal information about officers contained in email could become public," (P5, notes), or that "infrastructure" (P3, notes) or "deployment information" (P8, notes) would become public.

Many of the concerns cited by participants for their projected decreased use of email if faced with an "open email" system are specifically allowed exemptions in the CPRA. However, even participants who were familiar at a high level with the CPRA were not familiar with the exemptions provided in the law. More surprisingly, nearly all participants felt that the "open email" system described in the hypothetical would change their behavior, yet even today the same material is available by request. This distinction can be understood as the difference between public information and published information.
