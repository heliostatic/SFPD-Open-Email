# Findings #

The findings from the interviews are divided into two sections. In the first section, I have identified themes in the current use of email by the SFPD. These include the reasons people use email, issues with the current system, and uses of technology outside what the department issues. In the second section, I've identified issues pertaining to privacy, transparency, and the use of email.

## Current Use

### Email use is socially contingent ##

The most reliable predictor of email use within the police department is the use of email by peers, either within or outside the department. Among participants with department issued email accounts, email is used to communicate with a wide variety of parties, including peers within a division, managers or superior officers, outside agencies, city attorneys, contractors and vendors, and the public. Participants whose interactions are primarily with other email users are most likely to prefer email as a communication medium. As one participant clearly put it, "I would say I prefer email for most communication," (P11, notes). The converse is also true. For participants with email accounts who interact primarily with members of the department who don't have email, it is not the preferred form of communication, regardless of whether a particular interaction could take place over email. One participant described this mindset particularly well:
>In the world of police work, we're up-to-date as far as technology is concerned, but my personal belief... being a police officer is a different world. When you're on patrol, after the morning meeting, you hit the ground running. (P7, notes)

Because of the disparity of use within the department, participants situated at the boundaries between groups that use email extensively and groups that either don't have or don't use email found email particularly problematic. These participants found they were often required to use email for reporting to their superiors (P7, P8, P13, notes), and were expected to respond in the same medium for those communications, but couldn't rely on email for communicating with peers or subordinates. Consequently, they tended to view email as an inconvenience that took time and attention, but offered little benefit.

Participants also valued sending and receiving email differently. Participants more often valued the ability to send email over receiving (P3, notes). In part this is due to norms of use and etiquette, as discussed below, but participants also attributed the difference to the asynchronous nature of email. The convenience of being able to send an email at any time became an inconvenience when it meant having to check email throughout the day.

### Trust and reliability are the most critical factors when communicating ##

In police work, trust is critical. In many of the interviews, participants indicated that people are trusted, while machines are not. For important communication, interoffice memo (IOM) is the preferred means of delivery. This is especially true for sensitive or confidential information (P3, P6, P7, notes). Conversely, email is viewed as inherently insecure, "Anything can be hacked. It might just be a question of when," (P8, notes). Another way in which the difference in trust manifests is in participants' sense of chain of command. In explaining why IOM is preferred over email, a participant said, "With email, someone can send a message to anyone, and you won't know. With [IOM] you send it to your superior, and you know it follows the chain of command," (P3, notes).

There is nothing inherent to the technology that makes email less able to be sent in line with the chain of command, yet for many participants, there is something inherently untrustworthy about the medium. The same belief if was expressed by participants discussing sharing information with the public. Today, information that is shared with the public goes through a human filter in the police department. For some information, the filter is the legal division. For other information, such as police reports, the records clerk manages most disclosures. When asked about automated systems for sharing information with the public, participants were uncomfortable. As one participant said, "I'd worry if it were automated, something would go wrong," (P2, notes). Another had similar concerns, "My gut feeling is no, it isn't possible to have sufficient technical safeguards," (P11, notes).

In addition to the culture of the police department, which has long put trust in people and processes to ensure consistent, appropriate behavior, there is the question of accountability. Removing human actors from a system of information transmission and disclosure makes it unclear how to assign blame when there is a problem. At the recent Pervasive and Autonomous Information Technology (PAIT) conference in Cincinnati, this question was addressed directly. Since the mid-nineties, there has been work considering accountability in human-computer systems (Nissenbaum, 1994), but as technology gets more sophisticated, autonomous agents can perform many of the tasks previously performed by human actors. If the filtering of documents to be shared with the public is performed by a piece of software, who is accountable when something is shared inappropriately? Faced with this question, and no clear answer, the participants in these interviews expressed distrust of automated systems and preferred to rely on tested processes relying on human actors.

Related to the issue of trust is the issue of reliability. One reason cited by some participants for not using email is the time it takes. In many areas of the department, computers are shared resources. For accountability, users must login to computers with their own, unique usernames. On some computers, this can take as long as ten minutes (P8, notes), since the department uses "roaming profiles" that must pull individual user data from a central server (P1, notes). After logging in to the desktop system, users must login to the email system, which requires a different username and password. If any of these systems is experiencing technical issues, the user is not able to send an email. Consequently, for users without dedicated computers, sending an email often takes ten times as long as making a phone call.

### There isn't a developed culture or set of policies around computer use generally, email use specifically, nor is there consistent, extensive training on the use of these tools for non-investigative purposes ##

>"I don't know. We have a computer policy about what you can load on them, but I don't know that they've come out with thou shalt not email this or that." (P8, notes)

>"General Order 10.08 came out in 2002 and addressed the personal use of computers, what passwords should be on there, etc. That needs to be updated to address changes in technology and new equipment." (P4, notes)

>"San Francisco is unique. You'll find there's not one set way of doing things here." (P6, notes)



* The only DGO regarding email use is from 2002 and addresses inappropriate, but not appropriate, use.
* There is little awareness or, or request for, disclosure of email communication to the public.
* There is no training on what information can or can't be shared over email.
* In contrast, there is some training and policy about police reports, as they are often released to the public.
* People have developed personal habits and standards for separating work and personal email.
	* Practices vary, but most users believe they have good habits, even when their habits are described by other people as being examples of bad habits.
		* eg, 
			* Sending work email from personal accounts
			* Checking personal email accounts from work
			* Sending (non-sensitive) information between work and personal accounts
* Some users view email as being a tool that has the potential to disrupt the chain of command, again because of norms rather than technical differences between email and, for example, interoffice memos

###Individuals have access to technology beyond what is provided by the department ###

The SFPD has employs many technologies in the service of more effective crime prevention. Nevertheless, there are many technologies available to the general public that are not fully deployed within the police department. In some cases, when a technology offers tangible benefits, individuals use technologies that aren't purchased or deployed by the police department, and use those technologies in the fulfillment of their duties with the police department.

In general, cell phones are not provided to officers by the police department. Between thirty and forty members of the department have officially issued Blackberry devices (Meeting with city, notes), but these are typically issued lieutenants, captains, and members of the command staff or technical staff. Nevertheless, many patrol officers carry personal cell phones that they use in the course of duty (P9, notes). Patrol officers have several forms of communication available to them, including their mobile vehicle terminals (also know as mobile data terminals or mobile data computers, MVT/MDT/MDC) and radio. However, several participants said that many patrol officers use cell phones to communicate with other officers on patrol, with the station, and with members of the community. 

Cell phones are especially well suited to communicating with the public, and in Ingleside, there has been an experiment to provide beat officers with cell phones paid for by local businesses (SF Examiner, 2009) (P13, notes). Cell phones are also useful when there is a code 33, indicating that the radio is tied up (P13, notes), or when an officer needs to contact a specific colleague, such as a officer responsible for dealing with issues in the homeless community. In addition to being used for communication, modern cell phones can provide services not otherwise available, "I prefer to communicate via cellphone... It has tools you can use, maps, navigation... It would help out a lot if the computers in the cars had GPS. My phone alone can do more than the computer can do," (P9, notes).

The current department policy on cell phones, DGO 10.07, was last revised in 1996. It does not address the use of cell phones by patrol officers, nor does it address the use of cell phones with advanced functionality. Indeed, the devices available today have functionality that would have been difficult to imagine in 1996.

Participants also discussed their use of non-department issued email accounts. Many participants, both those with and without department issued email accounts, indicated that they use non-department issued email accounts (meaning accounts not at the sfgov.org domain) for work email. As one participant said, "I hardly ever use the sfgov email. It's so hard to get around. I mostly use an external, dedicated account," (P4, notes). The most common reasons for using third party email accounts were the poor usability of the Lotus Notes email client, limitations on file attachment size, and challenges accessing the sfgov email account from home. Several participants said they use non-department issued accounts at home to send themselves articles relevant to work at their sfgov accounts. Other participants described using non-department issued accounts to back up non-sensitive files or information for easy retrieval. One participant mentioned using a non-department issued account because a request for an sfgov account had not been filled, and an email account was required for work (P13, notes).

In every case, participants said that they are careful not to share sensitive information over non-sanctioned channels. Nevertheless, most participants indicated using at least one form of non-department issued communication.

## Openness and Transparency

In the course of this research, I posed a hypothetical situation to the participants. It was very broad, and designed to evoke an emotional and exploratory response. The situation I posed was for participants to "imagine a website where a member of the public is able to search through and read email sent and received by all city employees. Some messages, and some parts of other messages, will be filtered out of this system to comply with the law, and will not be available to the public." From the ensuing discussion, I've identified three major themes. For the purposes of the following discussion, the system described in the hypothetical is referred to as an "open email" system.

### Users understand and respect the public right to information, but worry about balancing that with the ability of the PD to do its job

>"Everybody can't have everything, but my gut feeling is that if there is a legal reason, an entitlement to access, then so be it. Otherwise, maybe everybody should just do their own jobs... However, there is absolutely no justification to hide things that need to be public, even if they're terrible. You have to sack up and own it." (P11, notes)

>"The Blackberries, with the messages back and forth on the Blackberries, there's a lot of preliminary information [during investigations] shared on those, which are PIN messages, not email." (P2, notes)

>"There are certainly things you wish people hadn't said, but they're not covered by any kind of protection." (P2, notes)

>"There's a culture in policing of being pretty careful who you tell what, sometimes to the point where it's pretty silly." (P2, notes)

>"If people need to see everything we're doing, they have too much time on their hands." (P5, notes)

>"There has to be a certain amount of trust from the public. We're trusted to carry guns, which the public pays for, but I wouldn't let a member of the public hold my gun." (P13, notes)

Nearly every participant expressed a strong commitment to the public's right to information, but this was often balanced by a competing interest:
>Transparency is important. The public is entitled to that. But you have to be able to operate the government safely and effectively. There must be an analysis under which the people's entitlement to be privy to the operation of their government comports with the safe and efficient operation of that government. (P11, notes)



* Within the police department, there is culture of protection of information
	* quote from Lt. Silverman
* For police, there is "right to know, need to know" training and attitude, which colors their views.
	* The balancing of interests is a traditional privacy view in the sphere of public access to government information
* Many users are not directly aware of the CPRA

### Transparent email will lead to performative behavior

In addition to concerns about efficiency, public safety, and privacy, many participants expressed opinions about the way an open email system would change their use of email. A common sentiment was about stylistic changes, "I think it would make me more formal in my writing," (P2, notes), and some participants felt more self-conscious, "You definitely want to make sure you have spellcheck on. And what about people who don't have English as a first language?" (P5, notes). For some participants, the issue raised questions about their current use of email, "After six years, I'm pretty careful about what I say in emails, but not always," (P8, notes). Among all participants, there was a sense that "open email" would lead to more thoughtful, or more deliberate, use of email. As one participant said, "it reduces the freedom to be wrong" (P8, notes).

Latent in this finding is the Foucauldian sense of self-regulation in the face of pervasive sousveillance (Foucault, 1995). The potential for surveillance as a means of exerting power has been explored in the online space (Boyle, 1997) through a Foucauldian lens, but in these findings we see is potentially an inversion of the traditional dynamic. Rather than the state exercising power through surveillance of the public, through the involuntary disclosure of communication that participants feel is relatively private, the public is able to exercise power through sousveillance. And as in Bentham's panopticon, those under observation consider action in line with the image they feel they are meant to portray.

### Email would be used less

After expressing concerns about the potential harms of "open email" and thinking about new expressions of self-regulation, I encouraged participants to think about how such a system would effect their own use of email. Consistently, participants said that if there were an "open email" system, they would use email less. One typical response was to shift communication from email to another form of communication, "Definitely. I would use the phone more than send an email," (P6, notes). For some, this shift would clearly entail using a less efficient form of communication, "Email is so efficient, moving away would really slow us down," (P5, notes).

Several reasons for the decrease in use were cited. Some participants were concerned about the possibility of subordinates viewing their superiors' email in order to gain early information about transfers or position openings. Others saw the possibility of exhaustive email searches being used in retaliation in order to commit "organizational terror," (P2, notes). Another participant referred to the use of email in crafting new policies, and worried that "open email" would inhibit honest discussion. Many participants expressed concern for the privacy and safety of the officers themselves. Among these concerns was a fear that "personal information about officers contained in email could become public," (P5, notes), or that "infrastructure" (P3, notes) or "deployment information" (P8, notes) would become public.

Many of the concerns cited by participants for their projected decreased use of email if faced with an "open email" system are specifically allowed exemptions in the CPRA. However, even participants who were familiar at a high level with the CPRA were not familiar with the exemptions provided in the law. More surprisingly, nearly all participants felt that the "open email" system described in the hypothetical would change their behavior, yet even today the same material is available by request. This distinction can be understood as the difference between public information and published information.
