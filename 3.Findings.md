# Findings #

## Current Use

### Email use is socially determined ##

>"I would say I prefer email for most communication." (P11, notes)

>"In the world of police work, we're up-to-date as far as technology is concerned, but my personal belief... being a police officer is a different world. When you're on patrol, after the morning meeting, you hit the ground running." (P7, notes)

>"I don't use email in my job." (P9, notes)

The most reliable predictor of email use within the police department is the use of email by peers, either within or outside the department.

* Use varies with rank and role
* Perception of value depends heavily on social demand
* Email is often used to communicate outside of the police department
	* Public
	* Other LEAs
* Email is sometimes used to communicate with superiors
* Users have different feelings about, and value differently, sending and receiving email

### Trust and reliability are the most critical factors when communicating ##

>"I'd worry if it were automated, something would go wrong." (P2, notes)

>"My gut feeling is no, it isn't possible to have sufficient technical safeguards." (P11, notes)

In police work, trust is critical. 

* Human communication systems are the most trusted
  * Humans are trusted to:
		* obey chain of command,
		* make good decisions about who to share information with,
		* properly follow procedures,
		* be accountable for their mistakes. (a tie into the PAIT side of things - many hands with automated systems)
	* Automatic filters are hard to trust.
		* It is hard for users to reconcile their personal views about privacy with the views of privacy embedded in a computer system.
* Computers are viewed as somewhat unreliable/slow. This decreases their value, especially when they are shared. Logging in for the first time on a system can take up to 10 minutes.

### There isn't a developed culture or set of policies around computer use generally, email use specifically, nor is there consistent, extensive training on the use of these tools for non-investigative purposes ##

>"I don't know. We have a computer policy about what you can load on them, but I don't know that they've come out with thou shalt not email this or that." (P8, notes)

>"General Order 10.08 came out in 2002 and addressed the personal use of computers, what passwords should be on there, etc. That needs to be updated to address changes in technology and new equipment." (P4, notes)

>"San Francisco is unique. You'll find there's not one set way of doing things here." (P6, notes)



* The only DGO regarding email use is from 2002 and addresses inappropriate, but not appropriate, use.
* There is little awareness or, or request for, disclosure of email communication to the public.
* There is no training on what information can or can't be shared over email.
* In contrast, there is some training and policy about police reports, as they are often released to the public.
* People have developed personal habits and standards for separating work and personal email.
	* Practices vary, but most users believe they have good habits, even when their habits are described by other people as being examples of bad habits.
		* eg, 
			* Sending work email from personal accounts
			* Checking personal email accounts from work
			* Sending (non-sensitive) information between work and personal accounts
* Some users view email as being a tool that has the potential to disrupt the chain of command, again because of norms rather than technical differences between email and, for example, interoffice memos

###Individuals have access to technology beyond what is provided by the department ###

The SFPD has employs many technologies in the service of more effective crime prevention. Nevertheless, there are many technologies available to the general public that are not fully deployed within the police department. In some cases, when a technology offers tangible benefits, individuals use technologies that aren't purchased or deployed by the police department, and use those technologies in the fulfillment of their duties with the police department.

In general, cell phones are not provided to officers by the police department. Between thirty and forty members of the department have officially issued Blackberry devices (Meeting with city, notes), but these are typically issued lieutenants, captains, and members of the command staff or technical staff. Nevertheless, many patrol officers carry personal cell phones that they use in the course of duty (P9, notes). Patrol officers have several forms of communication available to them, including their mobile vehicle terminals (also know as mobile data terminals or mobile data computers, MVT/MDT/MDC) and radio. However, several participants said that many patrol officers use cell phones to communicate with other officers on patrol, with the station, and with members of the community. 

Cell phones are especially well suited to communicating with the public, and in Ingleside, there has been an experiment to provide beat officers with cell phones paid for by local businesses (SF Examiner, 2009) (P13, notes). Cell phones are also useful when there is a code 33, indicating that the radio is tied up (P13, notes), or when an officer needs to contact a specific colleague, such as a officer responsible for dealing with issues in the homeless community. In addition to being used for communication, modern cell phones can provide services not otherwise available, "I prefer to communicate via cellphone... It has tools you can use, maps, navigation... It would help out a lot if the computers in the cars had GPS. My phone alone can do more than the computer can do," (P9, notes).

The current department policy on cell phones, DGO 10.07, was last revised in 1996. It does not address the use of cell phones by patrol officers, nor does it address the use of cell phones with advanced functionality. Indeed, the devices available today have functionality that would have been difficult to imagine in 1996.

Participants also discussed their use of non-department issued email accounts. Many participants, both those with and without department issued email accounts, indicated that they use non-department issued email accounts (meaning accounts not at the sfgov.org domain) for work email. As one participant said, "I hardly ever use the sfgov email. It's so hard to get around. I mostly use an external, dedicated account," (P4, notes). The most common reasons for using third party email accounts were the poor usability of the Lotus Notes email client, limitations on file attachment size, and challenges accessing the sfgov email account from home. Several participants used

* The department doesn't provide mobile devices to patrol officers, but most patrol officers have and carry personal mobile phones. Some of these phones include email. Even those that don't have email have cell phones with cameras, which provides them with the ability to share images from the field to the station, and more problematically, from the station to the field.
* Commercial email systems provide features not available on the SFPD email system, like large attachments and easy access from home.
* Examples:
  * personnel use non-sf issued technology and applications to conduct sfpd work, including email
  * examples of what they use
  * examples of why (not provided by sfpd; provided but lacks features)

## Openness and Transparency

In the course of this research, I posed a hypothetical situation to the participants. It was very broad, and designed to evoke an emotional and exploratory response. The situation I posed was for participants to "imagine a website where a member of the public is able to search through and read email sent and received by all city employees. Some messages, and some parts of other messages, will be filtered out of this system to comply with the law, and will not be available to the public." From the ensuing discussion, I've identified three major themes. For the purposes of the following discussion, the system described in the hypothetical is referred to as an "open email" system.

### Users understand and respect the public right to information, but worry about balancing that with the ability of the PD to do its job

>"Everybody can't have everything, but my gut feeling is that if there is a legal reason, an entitlement to access, then so be it. Otherwise, maybe everybody should just do their own jobs... However, there is absolutely no justification to hide things that need to be public, even if they're terrible. You have to sack up and own it." (P11, notes)

>"The Blackberries, with the messages back and forth on the Blackberries, there's a lot of preliminary information [during investigations] shared on those, which are PIN messages, not email." (P2, notes)

>"There are certainly things you wish people hadn't said, but they're not covered by any kind of protection." (P2, notes)

>"There's a culture in policing of being pretty careful who you tell what, sometimes to the point where it's pretty silly." (P2, notes)

>"If people need to see everything we're doing, they have too much time on their hands." (P5, notes)

>"There has to be a certain amount of trust from the public. We're trusted to carry guns, which the public pays for, but I wouldn't let a member of the public hold my gun." (P13, notes)

Nearly every participant expressed a strong commitment to the public's right to information, but this was often balanced by a competing interest:
>Transparency is important. The public is entitled to that. But you have to be able to operate the government safely and effectively. There must be an analysis under which the people's entitlement to be privy to the operation of their government comports with the safe and efficient operation of that government. (P11, notes)



* Within the police department, there is culture of protection of information
	* quote from Lt. Silverman
* For police, there is "right to know, need to know" training and attitude, which colors their views.
	* The balancing of interests is a traditional privacy view in the sphere of public access to government information
* Many users are not directly aware of the CPRA

### Transparent email will lead to performative behavior

In addition to concerns about efficiency, public safety, and privacy, many participants expressed opinions about the way an open email system would change their use of email. A common sentiment was about stylistic changes, "I think it would make me more formal in my writing," (P2, notes), and some participants felt more self-conscious, "You definitely want to make sure you have spellcheck on. And what about people who don't have English as a first language?" (P5, notes). For some participants, the issue raised questions about their current use of email, "After six years, I'm pretty careful about what I say in emails, but not always," (P8, notes). Among all participants, there was a sense that "open email" would lead to more thoughtful, or more deliberate, use of email. As one participant said, "it reduces the freedom to be wrong" (P8, notes).

Latent in this finding is the Foucauldian sense of self-regulation in the face of pervasive sousveillance (Foucault, 1995). The potential for surveillance as a means of exerting power has been explored in the online space (Boyle, 1997) through a Foucauldian lens, but in these findings we see is potentially an inversion of the traditional dynamic. Rather than the state exercising power through surveillance of the public, through the involuntary disclosure of communication that participants feel is relatively private, the public is able to exercise power through sousveillance. And as in Bentham's panopticon, those under observation consider action in line with the image they feel they are meant to portray.

### Email would be used less

After expressing concerns about the potential harms of "open email" and thinking about new expressions of self-regulation, I encouraged participants to think about how such a system would effect their own use of email. Consistently, participants said that if there were an "open email" system, they would use email less. One typical response was to shift communication from email to another form of communication, "Definitely. I would use the phone more than send an email," (P6, notes). For some, this shift would clearly entail using a less efficient form of communication, "Email is so efficient, moving away would really slow us down," (P5, notes).

Several reasons for the decrease in use were cited. Some participants were concerned about the possibility of subordinates viewing their superiors' email in order to gain early information about transfers or position openings. Others saw the possibility of exhaustive email searches being used in retaliation in order to commit "organizational terror," (P2, notes). Another participant referred to the use of email in crafting new policies, and worried that "open email" would inhibit honest discussion. Many participants expressed concern for the privacy and safety of the officers themselves. Among these concerns was a fear that "personal information about officers contained in email could become public," (P5, notes), or that "infrastructure" (P3, notes) or "deployment information" (P8, notes) would become public.

Many of the concerns cited by participants for their projected decreased use of email if faced with an "open email" system are specifically allowed exemptions in the CPRA. However, even participants who were familiar at a high level with the CPRA were not familiar with the exemptions provided in the law. More surprisingly, nearly all participants felt that the "open email" system described in the hypothetical would change their behavior, yet even today the same material is available by request. This distinction can be understood as the difference between public information and published information.
