# Recommendations #

The city of San Francisco and the SFPD face several challenges. These can be divided into three broad categories, with a discussion and set of recommendations in each. The three categories, broadly, are training for appropriate use of email, clear policies about the use of all available and currently used communication technologies, both department issued and non-department issued, and a thorough exploration of the risks and implication of an “open email” system.

## Training ##

The current state of training for the appropriate use of email within the police department is limited. In part, this is likely due to the fact that virtually no patrol officers have email accounts (P1, notes), making training at the Police Academy less useful. In contrast, participants spoke favorably of the training they received, both at the Academy and throughout their careers, in other areas, including report writing (P13, P11, notes).
Because email has been introduced on an as-needed basis, users have developed a heterogeneous set of heuristics for determining when it is appropriate to share information over email, with whom, and with what degree of confidence in the confidentiality of their messages. Many of these heuristics conflict with those developed by other members of the department, leading to a sense that “people have poor email etiquette,” (P3, notes). More significantly, different standards negatively affect efficiency and reliability of the medium. As described above, participants who sit at the boundaries between email users and email non-users are forced to adopt hybrid communication models.
A further consideration for training is access to computing resources. Of the approximately 1,000 SFPD employees without email accounts today, many are patrol officers. I found that among this population, the lack of email was not felt as a negative. Instead, there is a sense that the work environment, both the physical environment and the pace, are not conducive to relying on email as a regular form of communication. The exception to this would be if patrol cars had convenient access to email (P9, notes). Without email in the patrol cars, patrol and beat officers have to use the shared computers terminals in the station. Since these computers are also used for report writing, they are valuable commodities (P7, notes). Currently, there are technical limitations that make email access from the MDCs infeasible. Most significantly, the mobile data service available in the patrol cars is not sufficient to support heavy email use across the network. However, if this barrier were addressed, the hardware could support either client based or browser based email (P12, notes).
As email is adopted in a wider array of roles within the department, the need for training will only increase. Since there is a significant population in the department without email, any training program would have to address both current and future employees, requiring both Academy and on-the-job training.

##Policies

There is substantial confusion about what is acceptable use of non-department issued technology, as well as what best practices exist for the use of department issued technology. In GO 10.08 there is an instruction that SFPD employees are not to use department issued technology for personal use, but there is not a clear policy about using non-department issued technology for work. Even the instruction not to use department issued technology for personal use may not clearly articulate the privacy interests of individual employees sufficiently.
A recent case before the United States Supreme Court, City of Ontario v Quon, raised the question of a police officer’s expectation of privacy in conducting personal communication using a department issued pager. While the policy and details in the case differ from the policies of the SFPD, the case raises important issues for every police department. Among the issues in the case is the question of where messages are stored (Volokh Conspiracy, 2010), what constitute appropriate grounds for an audit of an employee’s messaging history, and what expectation of privacy an employee has when using a department issued communication device. The CPRA is brought to bear on some of these issues in the briefs submitted by both the plaintiffs and the defendants in the case, and those issues will be discussed below. However, the SFPD needs for clear policies, and clear articulation of those policies, for the appropriate use of department issued technology, beyond what is said in GO 10.08 d, which addresses misuse, rather than appropriate use.
While the department does have some policies about the use of department issued technology today, it has very little about the use of non-department issued technology. General Order 10.02 f.4 prohibits officers from carrying any items besides what is listed in the rest of 10.02 while on duty. General Order 10.07, which is not mentioned in 10.02, indicates that “in order to improve the Department’s communications capabilities, certain members are equipped with cellular telephones,” but 10.07 does not address the use of non-department issued phones. However, through the interviews, it is clear that many patrol officers carry cell phones. Participants indicated that these devices are useful for communicating with colleagues and the public, interests acknowledged by the department in GO 10.07. However, the policy has not been updated to clarify the department’s position on the use, or even the carrying, of these devices.
The department should issue clear policies about the appropriate use of non-department issued technology, as well as what the employees’ expectation of privacy is on those devices. Additionally, as some participants indicated, phones today are capable of more than voice communication. They include GPS, email, internet access, MMS, and SMS. In the near future, mobile devices will likely include additional functionality. Whatever policies are adopted today need to address the broader context of use, and not focus on a single technology.

## Open Email ##

The most challenging issue for the city and the SFPD to address is the development of an “open email” system. In addition to the findings discussed above, there has been significant work in the area of open government and transparency. While these topic, broadly, are not the focus of this paper2, it is important to understand some of the challenges that other systems have faced, and the issues that have been raised in this area.
Today, email sent to and from city employees is potentially public through a CPRA request. A similar situation existed with court records in the before the last decade. While records were available to the public upon request, essentially, they existed in “practical obscurity” (489 U. S. 749, 1989). Since then, court records have become widely available online, prompting a re-evaluation of dominant theories of privacy and the meaning of a public record. Several authors have suggested that the notion of privacy as synonymous with secrecy is no longer relevant (Solove, 2006; Barber, 2006, 2001; Nissembaum, 2004, 1998). Some authors cite specific harms that come from court records being made available en masse (Solove, 2001; Gottlieb, 2004; GAO Report, 2008; Opsahl, 2008), such as the disclosure of social security numbers, the aggregation of information, yielding a “data body” that is greater than the individual pieces of information disclosed, and unwanted marketing.
One of the challenges that arose in the digitization of court records was the fact that states, and even individual counties, handled the issue in very different ways. There was not a uniform approach. In 2002, the Conference of Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators produced a model policy for public access to court records that attempted to consider all the issues facing the courts and provide a set of guidelines and examples that courts could use in putting their records online. Considering the state of this process, as described in the Center for Democracy and Technology’s 2002 report, “A Quiet Revolution in the Courts,” such a model was sorely needed.
The judicial system has not been alone in facing challenges resulting from easy online access to electronic records. Some authors, and some participants in this study, have raised the issue of “naked transparency” (Lessig, 2009). The argument is that transparency without appropriate context invites misinterpretation. Lessig suggests that a member of the public with limited time and attention might see data appearing to show a correlation between campaign donations and a congressional voting record. Having discerned a pattern, the public assumes there is underlying truth and acts accordingly. But interpreting data requires understanding the context in which it is produced, and the assumptions it embodies. Similarly, participants in this study worried that “Email is a record, but it’s an incomplete record,” (P8, notes).
In the face of these dangers, some have advanced the view that a document disclosed to one party need not be considered absolutely public. In this way, privacy, stripped of secrecy, is no longer a binary condition. Instead, privacy can be a function of context (Nissembaum, 2004). In this model, the courts, or indeed any public agency, might grant access to public documents to an individual, but deny them to a data aggregator. 3
The biggest challenge faced by an “open email” system, as with the electronic court records, is that automated filtering is hard. The courts are still having problems with un-redacted social security numbers, and they deal with a relatively limited set of documents. The problem for an automatically filtered, push-publication email system is that the list of exemptions provided by the CPRA, and the very issues that participants expressed concerns about, require a high level of understanding of the content of communication, as well as its structural features. While a certain amount of role based filtering, for example emails sent to or from an attorney, is possible, tailoring these filters so they are neither overly protective or liberal will be very challenging. A system that is too conservative will not, ultimately, reduce the number of formal CPRA requests made to the city, a stated goal of the “open email” proposal. However, a system that is too liberal in disclosing sensitive material will push users to other communication media, and will reduce the efficiency of the SFPD while providing no benefit of openness to the public. On top of the technical challenge, there is a challenge in showing users that their expectations and the filters built into the system are in alignment. A commonly expressed sentiment among the participants is that without knowing exactly what would be filtered, the participants would err on the side of not using email at all.
The participants in this study demonstrated an implicit understanding of the distinction between potentially public documents and actually published documents. Their reticence to communicate in a system embracing the push-publication model, an “open email” system, is supported by the challenges faced by the court system.
Overcoming the technical and social challenges to an “open email” system might be possible, but would require embracing an alternative model for privacy. Such a model would require looking not only at what constitutes a public record, but at who can and should have access to each of those records. It is possible that this additional consideration is not supported by the law, although some authors have considered the question (Solove, 2002) and posited that this model may be compatible with open government laws, like the CPRA.
