yes training
maybe policies on non-sf issued devices and/or applications for work
yes on clarity about access model (published v accessible through cpra -- these are not the same)

* Policy is inconsistent and not present, in most cases. City Attorney and SFPD need to come up with policy about what kind of information is appropriate to send by email.
* SFPD needs training on email use. Right now, everyone has their own sense of what is "sensitive" and should or shouldn't be sent over email. Need a standard, and need everyone to know it.
* In the same vein as Police Reports, there needs to be an almost mechanical explanation of what can/will happen with the public disclosure of email, and get people used to the idea that even today, despite the practical obscurity, their email is potentially public. There needs to be a culture shift before introducing an "open email" solution, because with only ~50% of SFPD having email, a shift to "open email" would simply mean that those 50% never adopt email at all, and all others will use email much less.
